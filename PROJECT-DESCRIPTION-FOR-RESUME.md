## 🎤 Talking Points for Interviews

**"Tell me about a project you're proud of"**

"I developed an AI-powered resume analyzer that helps job seekers optimize their resumes. The system 
uses Java Spring Boot on the backend to process PDF and text files, extract skills using pattern 
matching algorithms, and calculate match scores against job descriptions.

What makes it interesting is the AI integration - I used OpenAI's GPT-4 with a few-shot learning 
approach, providing the model with example resumes to improve accuracy. The system analyzes resumes 
across multiple dimensions: keyword matching using cosine similarity, ATS compliance scoring, and 
semantic analysis.

The frontend is a responsive single-page application that guides users through a 3-step process. 
The entire analysis happens in under 3 seconds and generates detailed reports with actionable 
recommendations.

From a technical standpoint, I focused on clean architecture with separate services for PDF processing, 
skills extraction, ATS scoring, and AI integration. I also implemented comprehensive error handling 
and validation to ensure reliability.

The most challenging part was optimizing the AI prompts and tuning the matching algorithms to achieve 
over 90% accuracy in skills identification."
