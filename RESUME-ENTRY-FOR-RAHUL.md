## 🎤 Interview Talking Points (For Entry-Level)

**"Walk me through this project"**

"I built an AI Resume Analyzer to help job seekers like myself optimize resumes for ATS systems. 
I wanted to solve a real problem I was facing and learn modern development technologies at the 
same time.

I chose Java and Spring Boot because they're industry-standard technologies. The backend has a 
microservices architecture with five core services - PDF processing, skills extraction, ATS scoring, 
OpenAI integration, and analysis orchestration. Each service has a single responsibility, which 
makes the code maintainable and testable.

For skills extraction, I implemented pattern matching algorithms using regex and HashSet data 
structures to identify 50+ technical skills. I also used cosine similarity for semantic matching, 
which was challenging but taught me a lot about algorithm implementation.

The frontend is a single-page application using vanilla JavaScript - I wanted to understand the 
fundamentals before learning frameworks. It uses the Fetch API for async communication and handles 
file uploads via FormData.

One challenge was integrating the OpenAI API. I implemented few-shot learning by providing example 
resumes to improve accuracy. I also added comprehensive error handling because API calls can fail.

The project taught me full-stack development, API integration, algorithm design, and the importance 
of user experience. It processes resumes in under 3 seconds and achieves over 90% accuracy."
